# conda environment

This contain some automatic function to create env

## Install/Uninstall/Export your environment

I was make file bash for easy do it

For install environment, run **automatically_initialize_environment.sh** file.

```script
source ./automatically_initialize_environment.sh
```

For uninstall environment, run **automatically_destroy_environment.sh** file.

```script
source ./automatically_destroy_environment.sh
```
